# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Terrorism
Data scientists utilise exploratory data analysis (EDA), which frequently makes use of data visualisation techniques, to examine and study data sets and summarise their key properties. It makes it simpler for data scientists to find patterns, identify anomalies, test hypotheses, or verify assumptions by determining how to modify data sources to achieve the answers they need.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA), which typically employs data visualisation techniques, is a tool used by data scientists to explore, evaluate, and summarise large volumes of data.

By figuring out how to change data sources to get the results they need, data scientists may more easily discover patterns, spot anomalies, test theories, or confirm presumptions.
